# UMich SI 507 Final Project
This project was created as a final project for SI 507 at the University of Michigan's School of Information.

To run this program, download the Python file "finalproj.py" and the folders "covid_data" and "socioeconomic_data". These should be placed within the same directory for the program to run properly. The program creates several JSON files and a SQL database, which have been provided for reference and you are able to download these as your wish.

To have the most updated COVID-19 data available, download  the "us-counties.csv" file from the New York Time's GitHub respository ([Link](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.git)).
